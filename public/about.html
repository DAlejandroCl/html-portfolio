<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Diego Alejandro Clavijo Ladino, I was born in Bogotá
  Colombia and I am 24 years old. I am a Computer and Systems Engineering
  student at the Faculty of Engineering at the Catholic University of Colombia,
  currently I am in tenth semester, and I am not working right now. If I was not
  studying Computer and Systems Engineering, I would have liked to dedicate
  myself professionally to a game or a profession that is related to the arts.
  ​About my personality, I am a responsible, honest and very shy person. I am
  interested in programming, music, video games and sports. My favorite music
  genres are R & B or old rock, but I am used to listen different types of
  music. I like animals and until a few months ago I lived with 2 cats, Simba
  and Nahla. My native language is Spanish, but I have learnt English until B2
  level. My contact email is alejandro1clavijo3@gmail.com.
